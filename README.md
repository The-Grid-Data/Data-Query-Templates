# Data-Query-Templates
Provides a base set of well-structured GraphQL queries that can be easily customized or dropped into an existing codebase.

Data Query Templates is a collection of ready-to-use GraphQL queries, each accompanied by a detailed description and documentation. The repository is structured so that each query is placed in its own dedicated folder, making it easy to navigate, understand, and integrate into your project.
Overview

Endpoint: https://beta.node.thegrid.id/graphql

This repository aims to streamline the process of working with GraphQL APIs. By providing a set of well-structured, clearly documented query examples, developers can:
- Accelerate Development: Quickly copy and modify existing queries rather than starting from scratch.
- Learn Best Practices: Reference patterns for filtering, sorting, pagination, and more.
- Ensure Consistency: Adopt a standardized approach to how queries are organized and documented.

Each query directory follows a simple, consistent layout. Along with the GraphQL query file, you'll find a corresponding .md file explaining the queryâ€™s purpose, expected arguments, response structure, and potential usage scenarios.
